# odin-recipes

A simple project about recipes(HTML knowledge test)

Introduction :

This is a project to test my basic HTML skills I have learnt until 

now by following the odin project curriculum.

Added some CSS to this project.

Notable change: Changed the look of the index.html page by changing some CSS layout.

After Project report:

1. Have a good grasp on the HTML concepts taught to me by The Odin Project.

2. I need to get a better grasp on the concepts of git because I had to take some help by referring to the git section of the course.

3. Have a basic grasp of the concepts of CSS. Excited to learn more.
