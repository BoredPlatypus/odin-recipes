        It is believed that Butter Chicken was invented during 1930 to 1935,
        by Kundan Lal Jaggi & Kundan Lal Gujral, the owners of a restaurant named
        Moti Mahal in Delhi, India. The restaurant would usually have large orders
        of tandoori chicken but sometimes ended up with leftovers which were dry.

            <li>Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium heat. 
                Stir in onion and garlic, and cook slowly until the onion
